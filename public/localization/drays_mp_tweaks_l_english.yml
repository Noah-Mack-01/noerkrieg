 dray_habsburg_events.1.d:0 "With the death of his father Albrecht II in 1439, the yet unborn Ladislaus von Habsburg was willed to inherit the crowns of Austria, Bohemia and Hungary. Shortly after giving birth, Ladislaus's mother seized the Holy Crown of Hungary and had him crowned king in Székesfehérvár on 15 May 1440. In Bohemia however, the Hussite noblemen and towns did not acknowledge the hereditary right of Albrecht's descendants to the throne. For years now, the realms of Austria and Hungary have been led by regents acting in the child king's name. However, with Ladislaus now having reached the age of maturity, he has chosen to do away with his regents and assert power directly.

 versus_the_crusaders:0 "Morea vs. Achaea"
 versus_the_crusaders_desc:0 "When the Frankish Principality of Achaea conquered southward under Prince William II Villehardouin, they lost at the Battle of Pelagonia against Michael VIII Palaelogus and the enemy prince was captured. Such a valuable capture in battle led to the southern part of the Peloponnese being surrendered to the Byzantines and thus, it became the heart of the Despotate of Morea. Born in fire and bloodshed, Morea's regiments of fine soldiers and cavalry know all too well that what they fight for is the livelihood of the despotate and potentially all that graciously Greek in this world."
 invitations_to_outside_settlers:0 "Friends of Morea, Welcome!"
 invitations_to_outside_settlers_desc:0 "The economy of Morea is nothing too great as the land has been used by countless generations of Greeks whilst also coming under the torment of foreign armies marching through. In order to help reinvigorate the communities who till the land, we should invite settlers to Morea and be much more open to who comes to and from our land. Encouraging upward population growth should help us rebound from the depths of economic uncertainty."
 fortifications_like_the_hexamilion_wall:0 "The Hexamilion Wall Emulated"
 fortifications_like_the_hexamilion_wall_desc:0 "The only land connection to the Peloponnese has historically been along the Isthmus of Corinth, with this passage way being guarded by the mighty Hexamilion Wall built between 408AD and 450AD, during the reign of Theodosius II. Morea must take the Hexamilion Wall as an example of what kind of fortifications it can and should build, ones that last a long time and that can be improved upon as time goes on whilst also being stationed at key strategic points so that our enemies will have the hardest time possible besieging them."
 battles_for_aegean_dominance:0 "Ruthless Naval Warfare"
 battles_for_aegean_dominance_desc:0 "Morea's navy has never been anything serious when compared to the naval forces of Venice, Naples, or any other serious Mediterannean power, but we still have had plenty of experience fighting hostile ships in small-scale battles in the Aegean Sea. We should be learning from these various naval skirmishes and trying to improve our sailors and ships as much as we can so that we can overcome any foreign threat out on the open water."
 venetian_ties_throughout_morea:0 "Influential Venetian Merchants"
 venetian_ties_throughout_morea_desc:0 "Merchants from Venice are common in the Aegean Sea; they have been for centuries and will most likely continue to spread their influence far and wide. Over where we are, Morea is perhaps the prime beneficiary of Venice's outward influence since Venetian merchants do good business with Morean traders instead of Muslim traders to the north and east. Through these Venetian merchants, we will learn to refine our own trade practices and become a Greek entrepot."
 communication_between_our_forts:0 "From Fortress to Fortress"
 communication_between_our_forts_desc:0 "The various fortifications throughout Morea are strong in their own right, but they lack proper communication between their various locations. Whether we build dirt or paved roads or try set up various stations to facilitate communication between them, Morea needs them to be able to relay messages across the land so that a more effective resistance to enemy forces may be coordinated. Even partisans from local towns can be called upon by this enhanced communication system should the times call for it."
 new_home_for_greek_power:0 "Haven for Greeks"
 new_home_for_greek_power_desc:0 "The Despotate of Morea is a dim beacon of hope for Greek people, but one that shines nonetheless. Byzantium once stood as the bastion of Greek culture and tradition, but perhaps it is time for that torch to be passed on to their children who are more capable of bearing the weight of such a legacy. Such a legacy will be guarded at all costs and the military of Morea is prepared to fight to the very last man should said legacy be threatened."

But even today, the relations between the Turkish people and the Persians are suboptimal due to cultural and religious differences.\nAlthough we are now the overlord of the Persian region, it is only a question of time until the Persian gather under a banner in order to fight for their independence. The establishment of an eyalet which manages this troublesome region in our name might be the wisest decision."

Times have changed over the centuries, however, and we are more akin to a great city than a mere outpost. From humble foundations upward, we must seize power when and where we can and follow in the footsteps of our great ancestors."

Using these old traditions, we will ensure that our faith today shines as brightly as it did before."

The isolated parts of it harbor safe passage and resources, but other those parts, people are subject to the elements around them. It is through these difficulties that we have learned to hone our shock-based desert tactics, and when we need to fight oustide of Yazd, we will be sure to adapt these tactics to the different envrironments."

Though we can only speculate as to why they did so, one likely reason is due to the defensive nature of Yazd itself. Compounding upon this defensive mentality in our other lands will help us withstand future invasion from foreign rivals."

 haven_in_persia_desc:0 "For many years, we have been known as a safe haven for Persians everywhere, fleeing persecution or in need of respite. Yazd may be unforgiving to the invader seeking harm, but it is welcoming to those that see it as a fellow family member of the Persian region. With this in mind, expanding outwards will be less of any issue if we continue this policy of being a safe haven for Persian people."

His wars put Paderborn into a great amount of debt, necessitating financial restructuring and a shift in how economics played out in Paderborn itself. It is from his costly mistakes that we will learn from so that we are not lured into ruinous wars that devastate our economy."

We are hesitant to just let these reformers do as they please, but we cannot deny that some suggestions they bring forth are valid ways of improving Paderborn as a whole.

These disputes are often violent in nature and we can't seem to find a solid solution without favoring one side or another. It won't be a pretty ending for at least some of the people who choose a different faith than what is decided by our administration."

So crucial are these places that prosperity in this general region might never have come about if these places were not around, which is exactly why we must continue to build up Basra well into the future. It's docks and infrastructure are vital to sustaining a suitable rivalry with the other trade ports and drawing in key traders from afar."

Some settle down and propagate their teachings, others stop by and do business whilst still leaving an impact on the region, yet all of them usually stoke the flames of unrest in one way or another. As the tension builds, we will harken back to our base of power, the tribes of Basra and its surrounding areas, for capable fighters that know exactly how to defend the land by which they call their own."

The road ahead is not going to be easy due to Basra still contending with tribes across the land and foreign states staking claims across our territory, but we are seeing more money line our pockets and a stronger sense of trade power in the markets Basra has some influence in. It is a slow growth rate, but one that can certainly be maintained."

 buffer_zone_on_to_greater_heights_desc:0 "With our developments in and around Basra, we are not just building up our own market and administration, but we are also building up a base of loyalty in our own population. Yes tribal feuds and cultural clashes often occur because of our geographic position, but we would be wrong to say that we are not cultivating some sort of success within our own people.

When push comes to shove in wars and Basra cannot get imports, famines and plagues spread across the main city and surrounding areas to the point that internal unrest rises dramatically. If we can set up a series of grain reserves, put efforts into making sick camps and soup kitchens, and possibly even build up a suitable navy so that Basra does not have to fear blockades, then maybe we can overcome this final natural hurdle."

 rotenburg_castle_at_our_heart:0 "Residence at Rotenburg Castle"
 rotenburg_castle_at_our_heart_desc:0 "Established in about 1195, Rotenburg Castle has remained the residency for the Prince-Bishops of Verden since its inception. It serves as a status symbol and a good defensive structure to protect Verden from any ambitious ruler of Bremen, Luneburg, or some other state, though we must always keep in mind that the castle needs to be reworked and updated as time goes on."
 how_much_power_does_the_papacy_have:0 "The Fine Lines of Religious Power"
 how_much_power_does_the_papacy_have_desc:0 "Papal power in the far north is not as strong as it used to be as fissures within the Catholic faith are emerging as time goes on. We of Verden must choose a path in the near future and outline specifically where the boundaries of religious authority are since it is clear to all that religion mixing into international politics is causing more divides and more lives to be lost."
 love_hate_relations_with_bremen:0 "Love-Hate Relations with Bremen"
 love_hate_relations_with_bremen_desc:0 "At times we have ruled in tandem with the Prince-Archbishopric of Bremen, but these unions were never true personal unions of any sort. Rather, the relations between Bremen and Verden have been quite hostile at times since Bremen has more foundational power and thus more ambition. We should at least use the good relations we do have with Bremen to hire more skilled courtiers so that we of Verden can benefit from the times of peace between the two states."
 provisions_of_being_immediate:0 "Advantages of Imperial Immediacy"
 provisions_of_being_immediate_desc:0 "Much like how Bremen is of imperial immediacy, Verden has this status in much the same way. It yields a great amount of benefits for both of us, though we take it in a different direction than they do since we are more focused on building up internally instead of controlling a myriad of religious territories and such. Being of imperial immediacy will in fact attract highly skilled advisors to Verden that will be able to grant us a great amount of influence in the future."
 politics_of_the_circles:0 "Intricate Holy Roman Politics"
 politics_of_the_circles_desc:0 "The Imperial Circles are administrative groupings in the Holy Roman Empire that serve to organize common defenses and collect taxes from the land. They also help organize the Imperial Diet when it convenes, and Verden being part of one of these circles means it can step up into higher level politics as compared to what it can normally get into. Experience with these administrative groupings will help refine our diplomatic sector and also serve to help us learn about the intricacies of foreign affairs."
 controlling_verdens_politics:0 "Protection of Internal Cohesion"
 controlling_verdens_politics_desc:0 "We have worked hard to ensure that our political situation internally isn't threatened by massive unrest or foreign dynasties. Though some dynasties remain prominent in Verden and some groups of people try to sway things in a single, unilateral way, our Prince-Bishop and those close to him are always working to ensure that these efforts to thwart our stability and infiltrate our state are fended off."
 slow_acquisition_of_power:0 "Keep Verden Growing"
 slow_acquisition_of_power_desc:0 "We strive to grow in a number of ways and we are always seeking to accomadate people within our borders though some would think that our efforts are not enough for those that aren't of strict Verdner descent. Working on understanding the differences and being tolerant of differences of new people coming into our fold will help Verden prosper and become less of a center of unrest... We can let Bremen handle that sort of tension..."

 utilize_corsairs:0 "Utilize Corsairs"
 utilize_corsairs_desc:0 "The tradition of pirating and using corsairs for shady interests is well known throughout Algiers and our navy is especially adept at it. If we invest in improvements into training and the materials and weapons used by our corsairs, maybe we can see a boost in profits? Or maybe we can see more ships come into our fold when they engage in battles on the high seas; enemy ships are always useful, whether its for scrap material or for use in our own fleet."
 import_gunpowder_weaponry:0 "Import Gunpowder Weaponry"
 import_gunpowder_weaponry_desc:0 "We are often used to the traditional methods of doing warfare in North Africa: blades, spears, bows-and-arrows, crossbows, and armor of some kind. This, however, is slowly becoming outdated as more and more we are seeing 'firearms' show up on the field of battle and being used by both infantry and cavalry. Algiers is nothing if not adaptable and will take to integrating these new weapons into the military so that they are not chained to the combat tactics of old."
 desert_tactics:0 "Desert Tactics"
 desert_tactics_desc:0 "The unforgiving terrain of North Africa is where Algerian people call home, and with its natural harshness comes a rather inexpensive defensive measure. Fortifications are nice and good, and we will build some, but the desert is its own fortification, hand-crafted by nature itself for thousands of years."
 champion_naval_combat:0 "Champions of Naval Combat"
 champion_naval_combat_desc:0 "Trial by combat at sea is what Algerian sailors must endure, and each of our sailors that has passed the trial has proven to be a true champion out on the water. Whether they are raiding coasts, fending off enemy fleets, or doing 'private' contracts along certain trade routes, the Algerians know that they can and will be the champions of naval combat."
 algiers_city_of_refuge:0 "A City of Refuge"
 algiers_city_of_refuge_desc:0 "Algiers doesn't practice a very staunch version of Islam, normally,a nd the city of Algiers itself, a blossoming flower in the harshness of North Africa, is by no means a place of persecution for those seeking safety from other places. We will take these persecuted poeple in and promote Algiers itself, along with its other connected cities around the region, as a place of refuge and renewed prosperity."
 algerian_waters:0 "Algerian Waters"
 algerian_waters_desc:0 "The coasts of North Africa are divided, and the islands of the Mediterranean are home to various divisions of people who pay fealty to meanial lords and rulers.

 barbary_influences_desc:0 "The corsairs of the North African coast are renowned for their ruthless nature and their raids on Christian coasts and our coast has some of the best spots for them. The influence they hold in Tripoli is strong and we should be looking to cooperate with them so that we can steer trade income more toward us as opposed to elsewhere."
 control_over_inner_tribes:0 "Control the Inner Tribes"
 control_over_inner_tribes_desc:0 "Tripoli is known for its coast, not its inland part, for good reason. The coastal cities are lucrative for trade and havens for corsairs whilst the inner desert sands are home to roaming tribes of Berbers that are quite hard to control. This has to change with future times, however, as we can't continue to allow the tribes to roam and cause havoc on trade and internal connections throughout Tripoli. Utilizing them and making diplomatic deals with them so that we can slowly integrate them into the Tripolitanian state will help ensure that we can stay afloat in terms of reserve forces."
 tripolitanian_trade_measures:0 "Tripolitanian Trade Measures"
 tripolitanian_trade_measures_desc:0 "The trade along our coasts is lucrative, but dangerous for many, which is just how we like things. By taking greater control of trade measures and markets around us, we can start exerting more force on our neighbors and funneling trade into where we want it most. A few bloodied coins is fine, so long as the end profit comes to us."
 commanding_the_southern_med:0 "Commanding the Southern Mediterannean"
 commanding_the_southern_med_desc:0 "The Southern Mediterannean is rife with corsairs but not all of them are our own. We must begin to consolidate power over the coastal bases and promote our navy throughout the entirety of the Southern Mediterannean without mercy and without leniency so that we are ready for any threat out on the water."
 diplomatic_intrigue:0 "Diplomatic Intrigue"
 diplomatic_intrigue_desc:0 "The extension of Tripolitanian power outward toward other regions is known by many and as such diplomatic measures are being made toward us actively. We need to ensure that we can diplomatically manuever ourselves around the international stage well enough so that our rivals are not able to gain influence against us whilst our allies are seeing only the best side of us. Tripoli is a valuable place for many, who in the Mediterannean wouldn't be interested in it?"
 vie_for_naval_supremacy:0 "The Fight for Naval Supremacy"
 vie_for_naval_supremacy_desc:0 "The constant fight for dominance on the open water gives the navy of Tripoli consistent experience in combat, meaning that they are adept at fighting at both range and up close during naval encounters. Some of our top admirals are even keen on capturing enemy ships so that they can be repaired and used in the main Tripolitanian fleet later on, a strategy that may just come in handy sooner rather than later."
 construct_naval_bases:0 "Construct Naval Bases"
 construct_naval_bases_desc:0 "The entrances into Tripolitanian land that aren't harsh desert or small coastal villages are the main ports where trade funnels into. These are often times vulnerable to enemy ships firing on them or from invasion inland which, in both cases, puts the very life of Tripoli itself in danger. The answer? Naval bases and fortifications so that we can defend our fleets during repairs, construct ships at a faster rate, and also defend ourselves in a much more organized manner."
 bad_decapole:0 "Decapole"

 bad_schlosser_festunge_und_burgen_desc:0 "The decentralization and high urbanization that characterizes southern Germany also resulted in its cities becoming very well-defended. These fortifications contributed heavily to past failures in uniting the region."
 bad_landsknechte:0 "Landsknechts"
 bad_landsknechte_desc:0 "The Landsknechts were founded by the Holy Roman Emperor as a direct response to the feared Swiss mercenaries. They are renowned for their combined arms tactics, and their fearsome two-handed swords that could decapitate four men in a single swing."
 bad_volksfeste:0 "Volkfests"
 bad_volksfeste_desc:0 "Like their Bavarian neighbors, Swabian towns and cities have celebrated Volksfests—"people's festivals"—for centuries. At the conjunction of church holidays and harvest seasons, the plentiful harvests create a time of feasting, rest, and passing down of cultural traditions."

 seat_of_the_avignon_papacy_desc:0 "The memory—that of when Avignon was the seat of power of the Catholic Church—still endures to this day. The curia itself was moved to Avignon in 1309, and until 1403 it remained a prime contestant for Apostolic power as the Papal Schism raged on."

 renovate_and_keep_the_palais_des_papes_desc:0 "Though no longer the seat of the Papacy, the Palace of the Popes remains essential to Avignon's cultural and spiritual identity, while also serving as a genuine fortress. Such a marvel of craftsmanship and engineering evokes our devotion to God, and the prestige of our city. We must ensure the necessary repairs are taken, lest its glory fade."
 papal_library_and_the_university_of_avignon:0 "Advances of Avignon"
 papal_library_and_the_university_of_avignon_desc:0 "While our fortunes declined with the fall of the last Anti-Pope, Benedict XIII, the Papal Library and University of Avignon remain gems in Avignon's crown to this day. Retaining the knowledge that both produced and keeping these institutions alive is of the utmost importance to us."
